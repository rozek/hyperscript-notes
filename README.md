some notes on _hyperscript

[\_hyperscript](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/_hyperscript) is a relatively new programming language inspired inspired by [HyperTalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperTalk).

This repository is a (growing) collection of notes on \_hyperscript with code examples that go beyond of what a "normal" programmer would probably need.

> Just a small note: if you like this repository and seem to benefit from its contents, consider "starring" it (you will find the "Star" button on the top right of this page), so that I know which of my repositories to take most care of.
